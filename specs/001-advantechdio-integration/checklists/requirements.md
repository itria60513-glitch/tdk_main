# Specification Quality Checklist: AdvantechDIO Solution Integration & Interface Verification

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2026-02-25  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All items pass. Specification is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`.
- Success criteria SC-001 through SC-005 reference "zero errors", "100% pass rate", "at least one test per method", and "100% guard-path coverage" — all are measurable and verifiable.
- The spec references interface names (IIOBoardBase, IDI, IDO) as domain entities, not implementation choices — these are the contracts being verified.
- Edge cases cover: re-entrant Connect, partial configuration (DI-only / DO-only), Dispose error resilience, and negative index values.
